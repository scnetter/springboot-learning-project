# Spring Boot Learning Project

### Issues and Solutions
* Initial index page loads and server runs fine when using IntelliJ CE but not when using VS Code.
  * Looks Maven related. Need to troubleshoot maven config and plugins in VSCode.
  * Appears VSCode needs additional files under .mvn directory (jar, properties). Works fine with IntelliJ so will revist after finishing project in IntelliJ as a lower priority issue.
* Plugin example for frontend-maven-plugin is outdated in the book. Need to figure out current method and plugin before moving forward with JavaScript section.
